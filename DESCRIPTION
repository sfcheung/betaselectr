Description: Computes beta-selection, standardization in structural equation models and regression 
  models, standardizing only selected variables. Supports models with moderation, with product 
  terms formed after standardization. Offers confidence intervals that account for standardization,
  including bootstrap confidence intervals as proposed by Cheung et al. (2022)
